LatamChallenge

In this repository is the solution delivered by Luis Felipe Jerez to the Challenge Latam.

Where in the first place an exploratory analysis of the data is carried out, together with visualizations of certain ideas that could be useful for modeling.

Subsequently, tests are carried out with three classification models:
1. XGBoost
2. LightGBM
3. LogisticRegression

After finding the best model, we proceed to select features with LOFO.

Finally perform tunning of hyperparameters.
